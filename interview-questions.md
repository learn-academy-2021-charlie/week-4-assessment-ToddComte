# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: I know that instance variable start with the @ sign and are restricted. The differences I would say is in the behavior concerning inheritance. They are what we learned about today I'm still not quite familiar with them but I will study up and get to know them better.

  Researched answer:According to my research and the syllabus an instance variable are locally scoped with in their class. An instance variable are always prefixed with a @symbol at the beginning of the syntax. In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: These are chunks of code put together in a block and I believe that they are called with a function of the same name. It's like having a file cabinet full of files. You can open up the file drawer Labeled a through C and know that you are going to get files or blocks full of names a through C.

  Researched answer: In Ruby they have blocks which are like anonymous functions similar to JavaScript. Blocks can be created with the do/end keywords OR with {}. Blocks are code that is passed to a method. I always like to think of these as building blocks.Each building block contains code that makes it easier to stack on top of one another and make a tower like I used to do when I was five. They are just another tool in my arsenal I can use in my future career.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I do believe an implicit return is a return that wasn't exactly asked for but Ruby has returned the last executable instructions. Meaning that Ruby doesn't really know what you're asking for but it will show you where it the code broke.

  Researched answer: So I was kind of right according to the syllabus it states that implicit return means the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without using the keyword return. When using implicit returns, object literals must be wrapped in parenthesis so that the curly braces are not mistaken for the opening of the function’s body.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming deals with building your project or code by using objects like building blocks and functional programming is like building the project or the code for functionality not structure wise.

  Researched answer:My research the definition of object oriented programming is s a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. The definition of functional programming is s a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. By reading these two definitions you can see that they are as different as No butter and jelly. They are good by themselves but they're really good when put together.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is like a container and that holds objects and values in an object can be all different types of data. Classes are just a organizational tool for those objects.So to me the big difference between them is organization.

  Researched answer: During my research I found that a class is a template for objects. Objects are instance of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings. So like I was saying earlier classes are like blue prints of a building and the building materials are your objects. I just wish knowing all the methods and the santex was as easy to understand what the difference between a class and object is.



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: We just learned about this and it sets up setters and getters in Ruby for your classes. It's basically the short hand for writing your classes.

  Researched answer: In my research I have found that attr_accessor automatically sets up getters and setters for instance variables. Using attr_accessor allows us to set and get values from outside of the class. Which is really helpful because it takes two commands and smashes them down to one.As we know somethings are better couple together than alone. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: This is a open source free to use data base management system.
 
2. Ruby on Rails: This is a server side web based framework application

3. CRUD: CRUD stand for create, read, update, and delete. It is the four basic operations of persistent storage.

4. ORM: ORM stand for object–relational mapping. It is for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. 

5. Active Record: This facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
